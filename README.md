#GPS Guided Rover

This project requires two 37D Pololu gearmotors as well as a motor driver. 
A 12V 3800mAh battery is used to power the project; the adafruit GPS 
breakout board served as a capable GPS module. 

A Processing input application is included to download coordinates to the rover (stored in the Arduinoâ€™s EEPROM).

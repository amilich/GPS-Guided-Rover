{"body":"### GPS Guided Rover\r\n\r\nA small rover is designed to drive directly to a GPS waypoint. Critical to the project, a small GPS unit is mounted on the rover’s surface. Location data is converted to a usable form and a path calculated. The car makes an estimate of how far to turn, then re-calibrates its location. This process continues until the car has reached its destination.\r\n\r\nThe project utilizes the haversine formula to calculate the distance between two latitude and longitude points. Using the heading determined by the GPS proved highly inaccurate; I chose to mount a compass module to the car, reducing the need to constantly re-calibrate to correctly estimate the car’s heading.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAndrew M.
